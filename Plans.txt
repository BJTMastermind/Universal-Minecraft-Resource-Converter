Plans:
[!] Move all .py files inside the Jar if possible.
Merge 3 screens into 1 and just change elements of the screen.

Not for some time Plans:
[!] If possible replace all Python file functionality with Java code.

-------------------------

If you know Java vary well and know how to acheive any of these with a [!] then create a feature request in Issues 
with the Java Code, it must work for all platforms and say what the code does. Thanks
